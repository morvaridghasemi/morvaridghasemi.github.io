				<h4>Tower of Babel - Pit of Babel</h4>
				<p>The Tower of Babel was built when all people spoke the same language, after the destruction of the tower people were scattered and new languages were born, and when people wandered the earth in search of progress and imagination. The tower gave way to digging a hole deep in the ground. </p>

				<h4>Present Continuous</h4>
				<p> Throughout history, humans have become the owner of the earth. They have devastated the environment to advance their authority by dominating nature. Human activities on the Earth have caused humans to become alien to their surroundings and even to their own bodies. Wandering man seeks to satisfy his desire to swing like a pendulum between suffering and pleasure, between life and death, and this pendulum swing is repeated with complete obligation for the sake of their progress. Because stopping equals the end of man and everything they have made is destroyed in the environment.</p>

				<h4>Scene</h4>
				<p>In this video we see similar pieces of bodies that are in the same size and move in similar patterns. The repetition of these movements in all shots indicates that the body is addicted to them over time due to a lot of daily work. Movements are not useful anymore and they only cause the body to erode while the obligation that is the root reason behind these movements is forgotten during the time. This amputated human body appears not just as a metaphor but as a historical fact.</p>

				<h4>Rat Race</h4>
				<p>In a factory, productive hours are the ones used for producing goods. The only thing remains from this process is a corpse of life that merely leaves traces of what was produced. When production halts and the machines shut down, the products remain, amassed, products of consuming and devouring time and bodies, as if bought in advance by their never ending show in the media. When the image of something, the copy is preferred to the original, the real version, a nightmarish play forms. Whatever remains on the stage is the result of the efforts, interactions, and silence, and now what is presented is an aura that carries the condensed essence of time, productive and dead times.</p>

				<p>In this artwork, the artist's body parts are scattered around a sewing machine and move independently of one another. The artist's feet operate the sewing machine treadle to stitch the body parts together, but this process is repeatedly done without success. Ultimately, the body is left with only the experience of pain and death, as the parts remain unpatched.</p>

				<h4>I'm not alone! [ <a href="https://vimeo.com/106612325" class="icon fa-vimeo-square"> Vimeo </a> ]</h4>
				<p>I explore my internal relationship with myself in order to combat feelings of loneliness. Through moving my body parts, I strive to survive and repeat these motions. However, in the process of reproducing these movements, my body begins to resemble a robotic machine. Despite this, the repetitive mechanical motions I perform enable me to gain a sense of control over the world around me.</p>

				<p>It is hard to differentiate between the human body and the human made today. This video represents a new form of a human body incorporated with objects. However, this process of the new organ would take the human being neither to the origin of his subjectivity nor an object.</p>

				<h4>Building’s Collection!</h4>
				<p>The historical oppression of women is a pervasive issue that affects all generations and cultures. This repression is largely driven by capitalism, which utilizes patriarchal methods to subjugate women. However, this approach not only harms women, but men as well.</p>
